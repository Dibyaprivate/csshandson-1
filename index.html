  <h3>what is css?</h3>
  <ol type="1">
<li>CSS stands for cascading style sheets.</li><br>
<li>CSS defines how html elements are to be display on screen,paper,or in other media</li><br>
<li><span id="pan">Css is not necesory</span><span class="banty">css saves a lot of work,</span>it can cantrol the layout of multiple web pages all at once </li><br>
<li class="ex">External stylesheets are stored in css files.</li>
 </ol>
<h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements </li>
  <li>internal-by using a style element in the head section</li>
  <li>External-by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
  <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However,<span>in this tutotrial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for youto try it yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>when comparing CSS class vs id.the difference is that css class applies a style to multiple elements.ID.on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL directly to an element and it's used by javascript.</p>
<p>In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been target,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
<p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
